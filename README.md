## Development

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Deploying latest code**

    Commit and merge into main branch for deployment.

    Netlify has been set up for auto-publishing.
